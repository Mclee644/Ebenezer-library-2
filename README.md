Ebenezer Library Management System

A modular Java application designed to manage library operations using custom-built data structures. 
This project emphasizes clarity, performance, and educational value by avoiding built-in 
Java collections and instead implementing core data structures from scratch.

 Data Structures Used

| Structure         | Purpose                                      |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `MyArrayList`     | Dynamic array for storing books and borrowers |
| `CustomHashMap`   | Fast key-value mapping (e.g., ISBN to Book)   |
| `MyQueue`         | FIFO transaction tracking                     |
| `MyStack`         | Undo operations and reverse-order processing  |
| `MyBST`           | Sorted storage and efficient lookup           |

All structures are implemented manually to reinforce understanding of core DSA principles.
